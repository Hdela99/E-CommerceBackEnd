Hello and welcome to my ecommerce back end app. This was made using sequelize, mysql2, insomnia as the testing ground for the backend, and dotenv for securing any sensitive information. This app demonstrates my ability to not only link the front end with the backend but also my ability to build the entirety of the backend along with linking multiple tables together to only show information that would be pertinent for an online shops user.
